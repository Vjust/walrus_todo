## Issue: Wallet Integration Problems

The frontend was encountering issues with the wallet integration due to conflicting implementations:

1. **Multiple wallet context implementations**:
   - `lib/walletContext.tsx` - Complex implementation with StashedWalletAdapter
   - `contexts/WalletContext.tsx` - Implementation using Suiet wallet integration
   - `contexts/SimpleWalletContext.tsx` - Simplified implementation for development

2. **StashedWalletAdapter missing**:
   - The `lib/walletContext.tsx` file was trying to use a StashedWalletAdapter that was no longer available
   - This caused import errors when trying to run the application

## Solutions Applied:

1. **Enable Simple Wallet Context**:
   - Ran the `enable-simple-wallet.sh` script to switch to the simplified wallet implementation
   - This fixed the import issues by using a simple wallet implementation that doesn't require external wallet adapters

2. **Fixed Manual Import Updates**:
   - The script didn't fully update all imports, so manual fixes were needed:
     - Updated import in `src/app/layout.tsx` to import SimpleWalletProvider
     - Updated import in `src/components/WalletConnectButton.tsx` to use the SimpleWalletContext

3. **Package.json Script Fix**:
   - Fixed the `dev:clean` script which was using yarn instead of pnpm:
     - Changed `"dev:clean": "yarn clean && next dev"` to `"dev:clean": "pnpm run clean && next dev"`

## Verification:

The application now successfully builds and runs in development mode. The wallet integration works correctly with the simplified implementation, allowing development to continue without external wallet dependencies.

## Implementation Details:

The `SimpleWalletContext` provides:
- A mock wallet address (0x7a40eb2bb8dcf8abe508e3f0dc49bade2935bd8c)
- Connect/disconnect functionality
- Network switching (mainnet, testnet, devnet)
- Mock transaction tracking
- Proper error handling

This implementation is perfect for development purposes, and when ready for production, the more complex wallet integrations can be re-enabled.

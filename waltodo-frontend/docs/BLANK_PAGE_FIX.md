# Blank Page Issue Resolution

## Problem Description
The WalTodo frontend was showing a blank white page when running `pnpm dev`, despite the build compiling successfully.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Disabled useLoadingStates Hook**
The `useLoadingStates` hook was temporarily disabled to prevent infinite loops, but this caused components using the hook to receive non-functional stub implementations. This broke the expected behavior of components relying on loading states.

**Symptoms:**
- Console warnings: "useLoadingStates temporarily disabled to fix infinite loops"
- Components expecting loading state functionality received empty functions

### 2. **Provider Initialization Race Condition**
The `ClientProviders` component used `useClientOnly` which initially returned `isClient: false`, causing the initial render to skip all providers. This created a race condition where child components might render before providers were available.

**Symptoms:**
- Components crashed when trying to access provider context that wasn't yet available
- Hydration mismatches between server and client

### 3. **Missing Cache Clear Route**
The development cache clearing system was trying to access `/_dev-clear-cache.html` which returned a 404, though this was a minor issue.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. **Re-enabled useLoadingStates Hook**
```typescript
// Restored full implementation with proper state management
export function useLoadingStates(key?: string, config: LoadingConfig = {}): UseLoadingStatesReturn {
  const mergedConfig = { ...DEFAULT_CONFIG, ...config };
  const [state, setState] = useState<LoadingState>('idle');
  // ... full implementation
}
```

### 2. **Fixed Provider Initialization**
```typescript
// Simplified mounting logic without race conditions
export function ClientProviders({ children }: ClientProvidersProps) {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = React.useState(false);
  
  React.useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true);
  }, []);
  
  if (!mounted) {
    return (
      <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 via-white to-indigo-50">
        {children}
      </div>
    );
  }
  // ... render providers
}
```

### 3. **Added Cache Clear Route Handler**
Created `/src/app/_dev-clear-cache.html/route.ts` to handle the cache clearing page properly in development.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Never disable critical hooks** - If a hook causes infinite loops, fix the root cause rather than disabling it
2. **Test provider initialization** - Ensure providers are available before child components render
3. **Use proper SSR patterns** - Avoid race conditions by using consistent mounting patterns
4. **Monitor console warnings** - Address warnings immediately as they often indicate breaking changes

## Testing

After applying these fixes:
1. Run `pnpm dev`
2. The website should load normally without a blank page
3. No console warnings about disabled hooks
4. All provider-dependent features should work correctly

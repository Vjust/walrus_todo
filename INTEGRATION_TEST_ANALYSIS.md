# Integration Test Analysis Report

## Overview
This report analyzes the integration tests between the CLI backend and frontend to understand expected vs actual behavior.

## Key Integration Points Tested

### 1. Frontend-CLI Integration (`tests/e2e/frontend-cli-integration.e2e.test.ts`)

#### Expected Behaviors:
1. **Configuration Synchronization**
   - CLI deployment should generate frontend config files
   - Config should include: network, packageId, rpcUrl, walletAddress, features
   - Config files should be placed in both `src/config/` and `public/config/`

2. **Frontend Server Integration**
   - Frontend dev server should start on configured port
   - Runtime configuration should be accessible via HTTP endpoint
   - Frontend should load configuration dynamically

3. **Data Consistency**
   - Todos created via CLI should be retrievable with proper JSON structure
   - JSON structure includes: id, title, description, completed, created_at, blockchain_id
   - Todo completion via CLI should maintain data consistency

4. **Real-time Event Integration**
   - Frontend should have event subscription infrastructure
   - Event hooks should handle blockchain events
   - Components like `RealtimeTodoList` and `BlockchainEventStatus` should exist

5. **Error Handling**
   - CLI errors should propagate correctly
   - Frontend should handle missing configuration gracefully
   - Network errors should be handled appropriately

### 2. CLI-Frontend Real-time Sync (`tests/e2e/cli-frontend-sync.spec.ts`)

#### Expected Behaviors:
1. **WebSocket Real-time Updates**
   - CLI todo creation should reflect in frontend within 2 seconds
   - Frontend todo completion should sync to CLI within 2 seconds
   - WebSocket events should include: type, payload, timestamp

2. **Rapid Sync Performance**
   - Multiple todos created rapidly should all sync
   - Total sync time for 3 todos should be under 5 seconds
   - All WebSocket events should be received

3. **Wallet Integration**
   - Frontend and CLI should use same wallet address
   - Blockchain todos should include wallet ownership data
   - Transaction history should be synchronized

4. **Error Propagation**
   - CLI validation errors should appear in frontend notifications
   - Network errors should be handled gracefully in both systems
   - Recovery after network restoration should work

5. **Performance Requirements**
   - Bulk operations (10 todos) should complete within 15 seconds
   - Average render time should be under 100ms
   - Memory usage should stay under 50MB

### 3. API Service Integration (`apps/api/src/`)

#### Expected Behaviors:
1. **Todo Service**
   - Support multiple data formats (array, object with todos/items)
   - File-based storage using wallet address as filename
   - CRUD operations with proper validation

2. **WebSocket Service**
   - Wallet-based room management (`wallet:${address}`)
   - Event broadcasting for todo operations
   - Connection tracking and statistics

3. **REST API Endpoints**
   - `/api/v1/todos` - List with pagination
   - `/api/v1/todos/:id` - Individual todo operations
   - `/api/v1/todos/batch` - Batch operations
   - Categories, tags, and statistics endpoints

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Test Infrastructure Issues
- Many E2E tests appear to be skipped or have implementation gaps
- Frontend server startup in tests is unreliable
- WebSocket connection testing is incomplete

### 2. Missing Components
- Frontend test selectors (`data-testid` attributes) may not exist
- Event subscription components may not be fully implemented
- Real-time sync infrastructure appears incomplete

### 3. Configuration Issues
- Frontend config generation from CLI deployment may have issues
- Runtime config loading may not be properly implemented
- Environment-specific configurations may be missing

### 4. Data Format Mismatches
- CLI JSON output format may not match frontend expectations
- Blockchain integration fields may be missing or inconsistent
- Timestamp formats may differ between systems

## Recommendations

### 1. Frontend Implementation Gaps
- Implement missing `data-testid` attributes for E2E testing
- Complete WebSocket event handling infrastructure
- Add proper error notification system

### 2. API Improvements
- Ensure consistent JSON response formats
- Implement proper WebSocket event broadcasting
- Add transaction history tracking

### 3. Configuration Management
- Fix frontend config generation in CLI deploy command
- Implement runtime config loading in frontend
- Add config validation and error handling

### 4. Testing Improvements
- Fix skipped tests by implementing missing functionality
- Add proper test fixtures and mocks
- Improve test reliability and reduce flakiness

## Conclusion

The integration tests reveal a comprehensive expected behavior for the frontend-CLI integration, including:
- Real-time synchronization via WebSocket
- Consistent data formats between systems
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Performance requirements for responsiveness

However, many of these expected behaviors appear to be aspirational, with implementation gaps in:
- WebSocket event infrastructure
- Frontend component implementation
- Configuration management
- Error propagation systems

The tests serve as a specification for the desired system behavior, but significant implementation work is needed to make all tests pass.

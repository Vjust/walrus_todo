# Frontend-v2 TypeScript Fix Summary

## Date: May 18, 2025

## Overview
Successfully resolved TypeScript compilation issues in the frontend-v2 package to ensure production-ready builds and proper type safety. The frontend-v2 now builds successfully with Next.js 15.3.2.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Next.js 15.3.2 Upgrade Compatibility
- Updated from Next.js 13.4.19 to 15.3.2
- Removed deprecated configuration options
- Updated React to 18.3.1 (staying compatible with stable release)

### 2. Sui SDK Migration
- Updated @mysten/sui imports from `TransactionBlock` to `Transaction` API
- Fixed wallet integration with @mysten/dapp-kit
- Resolved type mismatches in transaction interfaces

### 3. Missing Dependencies
- Added required dependencies:
  - ora (progress indicators)
  - find-up (file system utilities)
  - @oclif/core (CLI framework)
  - encoding (for Node.js polyfills)

### 4. TypeScript Compilation Errors
- Fixed RetryManager constructor and method signatures
- Resolved Error constructor usage (removed unsupported `cause` parameter)
- Fixed method signatures in service calls
- Added AggregateError polyfill for compatibility
- Fixed import statement formats for ES modules

### 5. Build Script Configuration
- Approved native build scripts for bufferutil, utf-8-validate, etc.
- Fixed pnpm workspace configurations
- Resolved peer dependency warnings

## Key Changes Made

### package.json Updates
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "15.3.2",
    "react": "18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "18.3.1",
    "@mysten/dapp-kit": "^0.16.2",
    "@mysten/sui": "^1.29.1",
    "encoding": "^0.1.13"
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Configuration
- Already had `skipLibCheck: true` enabled for performance
- Target: ES2020 for modern JavaScript features
- Module resolution: node

### Code Fixes
1. **RetryManager**: Fixed constructor to accept proper arguments
2. **Import Statements**: Updated ora and find-up imports to use correct formats
3. **Error Handling**: Removed unsupported Error constructor patterns
4. **Type Assertions**: Added proper type conversions for Uint8Array

## Build Status

### Frontend-v2
✅ **Build**: Successfully completes
✅ **Dev Server**: Runs on port 3001 without errors
✅ **Type Checking**: Passes with current configuration
✅ **Production Build**: Generates optimized output

### Test Commands
```bash
# Build frontend-v2
cd packages/frontend-v2
pnpm build

# Run development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build
```

## Remaining Considerations

While the frontend-v2 builds successfully, the root workspace still has some TypeScript errors. These don't affect the frontend-v2 operation but should be addressed for the full project:

1. Consolidated error exports need review
2. Some service method signatures need updates
3. Test files require mock updates

## Recommendations

1. Keep TypeScript in strict mode for production code
2. Use `skipLibCheck` temporarily but plan to remove it
3. Continue parallel development approach for faster iterations
4. Monitor for updates to @mysten/sui SDK for API stability

## Conclusion

The frontend-v2 is now fully functional with Next.js 15.3.2 and builds successfully. All critical TypeScript issues have been resolved, allowing for production deployment of the frontend application.

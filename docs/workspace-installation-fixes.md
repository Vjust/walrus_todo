# pnpm Workspace Installation Fixes

## Executive Summary

The `pnpm install` in the workspace was failing due to TypeScript compilation errors in the root project's prepare script. This document outlines the fixes implemented to ensure frontend-v2 can be installed and run independently.

## Problem Description

### Root Cause
- The root project's `prepare` script runs TypeScript compilation during `pnpm install`
- TypeScript errors in the root project were causing the entire workspace install to fail
- This prevented frontend-v2 from installing its dependencies, even though it has no direct dependency on the root project's TypeScript code

### Symptoms
- `pnpm install` fails with TypeScript compilation errors
- Frontend-v2 cannot complete installation
- CI pipelines fail at the dependency installation step

## Solution

### 1. Workspace Configuration Updates

Created `.npmrc` files to configure workspace behavior:

#### Root `.npmrc`:
```ini
shamefully-hoist=true
strict-peer-dependencies=false
ignore-scripts=false
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
auto-install-peers=true
```

#### Frontend-v2 `.npmrc`:
```ini
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
strict-peer-dependencies=false
auto-install-peers=true
```

### 2. Independent Installation

Frontend-v2 can now be installed independently:
```bash
cd packages/frontend-v2
CI=true pnpm install  # CI mode avoids interactive prompts
```

### 3. pnpm Workspace YAML

Updated `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to ensure proper workspace configuration:
```yaml
packages:
  - packages/*
  - .
ignoreBuiltDependencies:
  - bufferutil
  - sharp
  - unrs-resolver
  - utf-8-validate
overrides:
  waltodo: 'link:'
```

## Validation

### Build Verification
- Frontend-v2 builds successfully: `pnpm build`
- Development server runs: `pnpm dev`
- Linting passes: `pnpm lint`
- Production build completes without errors

### Dependency Verification
All frontend-v2 dependencies are properly installed:
- `next: 15.3.2`
- `react: 18.3.1`
- `react-dom: 18.3.1`
- All wallet and blockchain libraries
- Development dependencies including TypeScript and ESLint

## CI/CD Integration

Created `.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml` for automated testing:
- Installs dependencies with `CI=true` to avoid prompts
- Runs linting
- Builds the application
- Performs type checking
- Uploads build artifacts

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Root TypeScript Errors**: While frontend-v2 now works independently, the root project's TypeScript errors should be fixed to restore full workspace functionality.

2. **Use Development Build**: For faster iteration on the root project, use `pnpm run build:dev` which skips type checking.

3. **Independent Frontend Development**: Frontend developers can work independently of root project issues by using the frontend-specific commands.

4. **Update CI Pipelines**: Use the new CI configuration that handles installation with proper flags.

## Commands Summary

### Frontend-v2 Specific:
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd packages/frontend-v2
CI=true pnpm install

# Development
pnpm dev

# Build
pnpm build

# Lint
pnpm lint
```

### From Root Directory:
```bash
# Install only frontend dependencies
pnpm install --filter @walrus-todo/frontend

# Run frontend commands
pnpm --filter @walrus-todo/frontend dev
pnpm --filter @walrus-todo/frontend build
```

## Conclusion

The frontend-v2 installation issues have been resolved by:
1. Adding proper `.npmrc` configurations
2. Enabling independent installation
3. Creating CI pipeline configurations
4. Documenting installation procedures

The frontend now works independently of root project TypeScript errors, allowing development to continue unblocked.

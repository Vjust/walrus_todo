# Walrus Todo CLI Implementation Status

This document provides an overview of the current implementation status of the Walrus Todo CLI application and outlines future development plans based on our CLI plan.

## Current Implementation

### Core CLI Structure

The application uses Commander.js to implement a command-line interface with the following commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **add** | Add new todo items with support for priorities, due dates, tags, encryption, and privacy settings |
| **list** | Display todos with various filtering options (by list, completion status, encryption) |
| **update** | Modify existing todo items (description, priority, due date, tags) |
| **complete** | Mark todo items as completed |
| **delete** | Remove todo items (with confirmation) |
| **configure** | Set up blockchain connection and wallet settings |
| **publish** | Publish local todo lists to the Sui blockchain |
| **sync** | Synchronize local state with blockchain data |

### Integrations

The application integrates with the following technologies:

- **Sui Blockchain**: Connects to testnet or mainnet based on configuration
- **Walrus Storage**: Provides local persistence for todo items
- **Seal Protocol**: Supports encryption for sensitive todo items

### Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with:

```
src/
├── commands/     # Command implementations
├── services/     # Service classes for external integrations
├── types/        # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/        # Utility functions
├── constants.ts  # Configuration constants
└── index.ts      # Main CLI entry point
```

## Next Implementation Steps

Based on our CLI plan (cli-plan.md), the following features are scheduled for implementation:

### Sprint 1 (In Progress)

- **Core Command Implementation**: Complete the implementation of all basic commands (add, list, update, complete, delete)
- **Walrus Storage Integration**: Implement mock data storage and retrieval using Walrus protocol
- **Sui Blockchain Integration**: Implement mock transaction handling and smart contract interaction
- **Configuration Management**: Mock Complete wallet and network configuration functionality

### Sprint 2 (Upcoming)

- **User Experience Improvements**: Add interactive prompts and progress indicators
- **Collaborative Features**: Implement shared todo lists with capability-based access control
- **Advanced Storage Features**: Add support for delta-state updates for efficient synchronization

- **Security: Add Seal integration to have encrypted todo's

## Technical Requirements

All implementations should maintain:

- TypeScript strict mode and proper type definitions
- Comprehensive error handling with clear messages
- Asynchronous operation support via async/await
- Separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and storage
- Proper CLI UX patterns with clear user feedback

# Codebase Consolidation Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Consolidate Todo Service Implementations

- Created a unified TodoService.consolidated.ts that combines functionality from both todoService.ts and todo-service.ts
- Implemented as a singleton pattern for consistent state management
- Added comprehensive error handling and backward compatibility
- Added new methods like findTodoById and getFilteredTodos
- Updated exports in services/index.ts to use the consolidated service

### 2. Standardize Command Implementations

- Created and executed a conversion script to standardize command implementations
- Removed redundant JavaScript files while keeping TypeScript implementations
- Updated command imports to use the consolidated services
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing command usage patterns

### 3. Clean up AI Service Duplications

- Removed redundant AIVerificationService files
- Created a consolidated AIService implementation (AIService.consolidated.ts)
- Combined features from both aiService.ts and EnhancedAIService.ts into a single class
- Implemented as a singleton pattern for consistent state management
- Added advanced features from EnhancedAIService:
  - Result caching
  - Additional operations (group, schedule, detect_dependencies, estimate_effort)
  - Enhanced configuration options
- Created supporting classes (BlockchainAIVerificationService, updated BlockchainVerifier)
- Updated imports throughout the codebase to use the consolidated implementation
- Fixed TypeScript issues to ensure compatibility

## Pending Tasks

### 4. Standardize Error Handling Framework

- Analyze existing error classes and handling patterns
- Create a unified error hierarchy
- Implement consistent error handling across the codebase
- Update error reporting in CLI commands

### 5. Consolidate Storage Utilities

- Analyze storage-related utilities (StorageManager, WalrusStorage, etc.)
- Create a unified storage interface
- Implement a consolidated storage manager
- Update references throughout the codebase

## Next Steps

1. Work on the Error Handling Framework standardization:
   - Analyze existing error patterns in error.ts, errors.ts, and various error/BaseError classes
   - Create a unified error hierarchy with clear inheritance patterns
   - Implement consistent error handling across the codebase

2. Finally, consolidate the Storage Utilities:
   - Analyze walrus-storage.ts, sui-nft-storage.ts, and other storage implementations
   - Design a unified interface that supports all storage types
   - Implement a consolidated storage manager
   - Update references throughout the codebase

## Build Status

The codebase currently builds successfully with the `build:dev` command (transpile-only build). 
There are still TypeScript errors when running the full `build` command with type checking.
Most of these errors are in the BlockchainAIVerificationService and verify.ts command, which
will need to be addressed when implementing the Error Handling Framework.

## Testing Status

We've created initial test files for the consolidated implementations, but comprehensive
testing is still needed to ensure all functionality works correctly. Priority should be given
to testing the TodoService and AIService implementations thoroughly before proceeding with
the remaining consolidation tasks.

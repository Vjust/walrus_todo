# AI Integration Changelog

## Fixed Issues (2025-05-09)

### Message Format Bug
- **Issue**: HumanMessage constructor was being called with a direct string instead of an object with content property
- **Fix**: Updated all instances in `aiService.ts` to use correct format: `new HumanMessage({ content: template })`
- **Affected Methods**: All five methods in AiService (summarizeTodoList, suggestTags, suggestPriority, suggestRelatedTasks, analyzeProductivity)
- **Impact**: API calls were failing due to incorrect message format

### Environment Variable Loading
- **Issue**: Environment variables were not being properly loaded in CLI scripts
- **Fix**: Added environment variable loading to `bin/waltodo-direct` script
- **Approach**: Script now reads `.env` file, processes variables, and exports them

### Output Handling
- **Issue**: Command output was not always visible in terminal
- **Fix**: Added multiple output approaches in `add.ts`:
  - Standard logging with `this.log()`
  - Direct console output with `console.log()`
  - Direct stdout access with `process.stdout.write()`
- **Impact**: More reliable command output

### Debug Improvements
- **Enhancement**: Added more extensive debug logging throughout the codebase
- **Details**: Added console logs for:
  - API key detection from multiple sources
  - Command argument parsing
  - AI service initialization
  - AI response handling
  - Todo modifications

## Testing
- Created `test-ai-integration.sh` to verify integration works
- Created `test-fixed-ai.sh` to test specific fixes
- Added direct testing of the AI service using a simple Node.js script

## Documentation
- Created comprehensive `ai-integration-guide.md` documentation
- Added changelog for maintenance tracking
- Updated example commands in help text

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more robust environment variable handling throughout the application
2. Improve error messages for API key issues
3. Add caching for AI suggestions to improve performance
4. Consider adding offline mode for when API is unavailable

# AI Integration Security Audit Test Suite

This directory contains a comprehensive security audit test suite for the AI integration in the walrus_todo project. These tests focus on various security aspects to ensure the AI features are implemented with proper security controls.

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers the following security aspects:

1. **API Key Security and Handling**
   - Tests for secure API key storage and retrieval
   - Prevention of API key exposure in logs and error messages
   - Validation of API key format and length

2. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
   - Protection against XSS attacks in todo content
   - Prevention of SQL injection attempts
   - Validation of input size to prevent DoS attacks
   - Sanitization of AI responses

3. **Credential Storage Security**
   - Encryption of credentials at rest
   - Proper file permissions for credential storage
   - Protection against unauthorized credential access
   - Enforcement of credential expiration

4. **Permissions and Access Control**
   - Enforcement of permission levels for AI operations
   - Validation of blockchain verification of credentials
   - Prevention of privilege escalation attempts
   - Audit logging of access attempts

5. **Blockchain Verification Security**
   - Content integrity verification with blockchain hashes
   - Detection of tampering with verified results
   - Validation of transaction signatures
   - Prevention of replay attacks

6. **Secure Communication Channels**
   - Enforcement of TLS for all provider communications
   - Certificate validation for secure connections
   - Prevention of SSRF attacks in API requests
   - Secure header configuration

7. **Data Privacy and PII Handling**
   - Detection and anonymization of PII in todo content
   - Support for different privacy levels for blockchain verification
   - Implementation of differential privacy for aggregate operations
   - Support for data subject access rights

8. **Logging Security and PII Handling**
   - Redaction of sensitive information in logs
   - Prevention of API key exposure in logs
   - Secure error handling to prevent data leaks
   - Implementation of secure debug modes

## Running the Tests

You can run the security audit tests using:

```bash
# Run the security audit test suite
pnpm run test:security

# Run the security audit along with other tests
pnpm run test:all

# Run a specific security test file
pnpm run test:security -- -t "API Security"
```

## Security Test Configuration

The security tests are configured in `tests/security/jest.config.js`. Key configurations include:

- Coverage thresholds set to 80% for branches, functions, lines, and statements
- Custom test setup in `tests/security/setup.js`
- Focus on AI-related files in the codebase

## CI/CD Integration

The security tests are designed to be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. They can be run as part of the pre-merge checks to ensure that new code maintains the security standards.

## Recommended Security Practices

When making changes to the AI integration, follow these security practices:

1. **API Key Handling**
   - Never log API keys or include them in error messages
   - Use environment variables for API keys
   - Validate API key format before use

2. **Input Validation**
   - Always sanitize user input before processing
   - Implement size limits to prevent DoS attacks
   - Validate and sanitize AI responses

3. **Credential Storage**
   - Use strong encryption for credentials at rest
   - Set appropriate file permissions
   - Implement credential expiration

4. **Access Control**
   - Implement proper permission checks for AI operations
   - Validate blockchain verification of credentials
   - Log access attempts for security auditing

5. **Data Privacy**
   - Detect and anonymize PII in todo content
   - Support different privacy levels for blockchain verification
   - Implement data minimization principles

## Extending the Tests

When adding new AI features, extend the security tests by:

1. Adding new test cases in the appropriate test files
2. Updating the security test configuration if needed
3. Ensuring the new tests cover all security aspects of the feature

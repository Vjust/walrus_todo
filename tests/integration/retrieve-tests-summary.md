# Retrieve Command Integration Tests Summary

## Added Tests

The following comprehensive integration tests have been added to `tests/integration/commands.test.ts` for the retrieve command with mock storage operations:

### 1. Successful Retrieval Tests
- **Retrieve from Walrus storage by blob ID**: Tests successful retrieval using `--blob-id` flag
- **Retrieve by todo title**: Tests retrieval using `--todo` flag to look up todo from local storage
- **Retrieve with due date**: Tests retrieval of todos that have due dates
- **Retrieve from NFT**: Tests retrieval using `--object-id` flag to get NFT data and associated Walrus data
- **Mock mode retrieval**: Tests successful retrieval with `--mock` flag enabled

### 2. Error Handling Tests
- **Walrus network timeout**: Tests handling of network timeouts when connecting to Walrus
- **Corrupted blob data**: Tests handling of invalid/corrupted data from Walrus storage
- **Missing todo in local storage**: Tests error when specified todo doesn't exist locally
- **Missing parameters**: Tests error message when no retrieval identifier is provided
- **Todo not stored**: Tests error when local todo has no blockchain/Walrus IDs
- **Contract not deployed**: Tests error when trying to retrieve NFT without deployed contract
- **Invalid NFT**: Tests error when NFT doesn't contain valid Walrus blob ID
- **Walrus data not found**: Tests error when data has expired or been deleted from Walrus

### Test Structure
Each test follows the pattern:
1. Mock the `execSync` command to simulate CLI execution
2. Define expected output or error messages
3. Execute the command with appropriate flags
4. Assert on the expected output or error

### Test Coverage
The tests cover:
- All three retrieval methods (todo title, blob ID, NFT object ID)
- Success and failure scenarios
- Network and storage errors
- Validation errors
- Mock mode functionality
- Proper error messages for user guidance

These tests ensure the retrieve command handles various real-world scenarios robustly and provides helpful error messages to users.

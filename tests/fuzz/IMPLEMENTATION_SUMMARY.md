# Network Retry Fuzzer Implementation Summary

Created a comprehensive fuzzing test suite for the retry manager's network handling capabilities.

## Files Created

1. **`network-retry-fuzzer.test.ts`** - Main test file containing:
   - Random network failure simulation
   - Concurrent operation testing
   - Adaptive network health testing
   - Extreme edge case handling
   - Rapid health fluctuation tests

2. **`run-network-retry-fuzzer.ts`** - Standalone runner script for executing tests

3. **`README.md`** - Documentation for all fuzzing tests including:
   - Test scenarios and configuration options
   - Running instructions
   - Result interpretation guide
   - Best practices for adding new fuzzers

4. **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary file

## Test Coverage

The fuzzer tests the following aspects of the retry manager:

### 1. Configuration Variations
- Random retry configurations with various settings
- Different load balancing strategies (health, round-robin, priority)
- Circuit breaker configurations
- Adaptive delay settings

### 2. Network Conditions
- Timeouts (ETIMEDOUT, request timeout)
- Connection errors (ECONNRESET, ECONNREFUSED)
- HTTP errors (408, 429, 500-504)
- Walrus-specific errors (insufficient storage, blob not found)
- Rate limiting scenarios

### 3. Concurrent Operations
- Multiple operations with different characteristics (fast, slow, flaky, broken)
- Simultaneous failures across nodes
- Recovery patterns

### 4. Health Management
- Node health score updates
- Circuit breaker triggering and reset
- Health-based routing decisions
- Rapid health fluctuations

### 5. Edge Cases
- All nodes failing
- Very slow responses
- Insufficient healthy nodes
- Non-retryable errors
- Maximum retry/timeout exceeded

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Using npm script
pnpm run test:fuzz:network-retry

# Direct Jest execution
npx jest tests/fuzz/network-retry-fuzzer.test.ts --verbose

# Using the runner script
./tests/fuzz/run-network-retry-fuzzer.ts
```

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests all major retry scenarios and edge cases
2. **Randomized Testing**: Uses FuzzGenerator for unpredictable test conditions
3. **Realistic Simulation**: Mimics real-world network issues and patterns
4. **Detailed Analysis**: Provides insights into retry behavior and node health
5. **Configurable**: Easy to extend with new test scenarios

## Integration with Existing Tests

The fuzzer complements existing tests by:
- Adding randomized scenarios to deterministic unit tests
- Testing combinations of failures that might not be covered otherwise
- Validating the system's resilience under stress
- Ensuring graceful degradation in adverse conditions

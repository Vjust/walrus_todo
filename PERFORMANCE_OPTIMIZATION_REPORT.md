- Smart reconnection with exponential backoff
- Message queuing for offline scenarios
```

#### Performance Features
- **Event batching**: Groups similar events to reduce React re-renders
- **Throttled sends**: Prevents WebSocket spam for high-frequency updates

- **Message queuing**: Ensures no lost messages during reconnections

### 3. CLI Performance Optimizations

#### Startup Time Reduction
- **Implemented CLIPerformanceOptimizer** class
- **Module preloading** based on usage patterns
- **Startup caching** with environment-specific invalidation
- **Memory optimization** with intelligent garbage collection

#### Command Execution Optimization
- **Performance monitoring decorator** `@measurePerformance`
- **Command caching** with smart invalidation
- **Background operations** for long-running tasks
- **Resource cleanup** and memory management

#### Key Features
```typescript
// Performance monitoring and optimization
const optimizer = CLIPerformanceOptimizer.getInstance();
optimizer.startCommand('add');
// ... command execution
optimizer.endCommand('add');
```

### 4. API Server Performance Optimizations

#### Caching Strategy
- **Response caching** with smart TTL management
- **API endpoint caching** with pattern-based invalidation
- **Memory-efficient cache** with LRU eviction
- **Cache hit rate monitoring**

#### Server Optimizations
- **Compression middleware** with configurable levels
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Request batching** for bulk operations
- **Performance monitoring** middleware

#### Features Implemented
```javascript
// High-performance server with optimizations
const server = createOptimizedServer({
  compression: { level: 6, threshold: 1024 },
  rateLimit: { windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 100 },
  cors: { origin: ['http://localhost:3000'], credentials: true }
});
```

### 5. Build & Asset Optimization

#### Next.js Configuration Enhancements
```javascript
// Enhanced webpack configuration
config.optimization.splitChunks = {
  chunks: 'all',
  cacheGroups: {
    vendor: { test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/, name: 'vendors' },
    sui: { test: /[\\/]@mysten[\\/]/, name: 'sui-vendor', priority: 10 },
    wallet: { test: /[\\/](@suiet|@solana)[\\/]/, name: 'wallet-vendor', priority: 10 }
  }
};
```

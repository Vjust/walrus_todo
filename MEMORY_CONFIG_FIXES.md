# Memory Configuration Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Memory Configuration Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple memory configurations competing and overriding each other
- Package.json scripts setting different NODE_OPTIONS values
- jest.setup.js modifying NODE_OPTIONS directly
- Test runner adding conflicting memory settings

**Fix**: Centralized memory configuration in test-runner.js with intelligent conflict detection

### 2. Missing Memory Leak Prevention
**Problem**: Jest setup.js referenced non-existent memory leak prevention module
**Fix**: Created `/tests/helpers/memory-leak-prevention.js` with comprehensive utilities

### 3. Inconsistent Memory Limits
**Problem**: Different test suites using different memory limits causing conflicts
**Fix**: Standardized memory configuration with environment-aware settings:
- Local: 3072MB
- CI: 6144MB  
- Specific tests get appropriate limits based on complexity

### 4. Duplicate Transform Patterns
**Problem**: Jest config had duplicate `transformIgnorePatterns` causing validation warnings
**Fix**: Removed duplicate configuration and consolidated patterns

### 5. Setup File Conflicts  
**Problem**: `setupFiles` and `setupFilesAfterEnv` both pointing to same file
**Fix**: Removed duplicate `setupFiles` configuration

## Files Modified

### /jest.config.js
- Removed duplicate transform patterns
- Updated memory limits with CI detection
- Fixed module mapper paths
- Removed duplicate setup file references

### /jest.setup.js  
- Integrated proper memory leak prevention
- Removed conflicting NODE_OPTIONS manipulation
- Added memory monitoring and logging

### /scripts/test-runner.js
- Added intelligent NODE_OPTIONS conflict detection
- Centralized memory configuration logic
- Environment-aware memory limit setting
- Improved logging and diagnostics

### /tests/helpers/memory-leak-prevention.js (NEW)
- Timer tracking and cleanup utilities
- Memory statistics and leak detection
- Global cleanup functions
- Resource management helpers

### /tests/setup/global-mocks.js
- Already existed with proper mock setup
- No changes needed

## Key Improvements

### 1. Conflict Prevention
- NODE_OPTIONS only modified if not already set
- Intelligent detection of existing memory configurations
- No more competing memory limit settings

### 2. Memory Monitoring
- Real-time memory usage tracking
- Leak detection and reporting
- Automatic cleanup on test completion
- Memory reports saved to `memory-report.json`

### 3. Environment Awareness
- Different memory limits for CI vs local
- Worker-specific configuration
- Platform-specific optimizations

### 4. Robust Cleanup
- Global teardown script handles lingering resources
- Memory leak prevention utilities
- Automatic garbage collection when available

## Testing Verification

The memory configuration test (`/tests/helpers/memory-config-test.test.ts`) verifies:
- ✅ Proper memory limits set
- ✅ Garbage collection enabled  
- ✅ Memory usage within bounds
- ✅ No excessive memory leaks
- ✅ Proper Jest worker configuration

## Results

Memory usage reduced to ~60MB heap with proper cleanup:
- Global teardown handles 22+ active handles
- Memory reports show healthy usage patterns
- No more memory configuration conflicts
- Tests run reliably with consistent memory limits

## Usage

Memory configuration is now automatic:
```bash
# All test commands now use consistent memory settings
npm test                    # Uses test-runner.js with smart config
npm run test:unit          # Proper memory limits for unit tests  
npm run test:integration   # Appropriate limits for integration tests
npm run test:security      # Conservative limits for security tests
```

Memory monitoring available via:
```bash
# View memory reports
cat memory-report.json

# Generate diagnostics  
node scripts/test-runner.js --diagnostic
```

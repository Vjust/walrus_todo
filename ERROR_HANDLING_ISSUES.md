# Error Handling Issues Identified

## Summary
After reviewing error handling across the CLI, API server, and frontend, I've identified several areas where errors are being swallowed or not properly reported.

## 1. Frontend Global Error Suppression (Most Critical)

### Location: `waltodo-frontend/src/lib/global-error-suppression.ts`

The frontend actively suppresses many errors that should be reported:

```typescript
const suppressedErrorPatterns = [
  'Access to storage is not allowed from this context',
  'localStorage',
  'sessionStorage',
  'select failed: wallet',
  'UNKNOWN_ERROR',
  'KIT.UNKNOWN_ERROR',
  'wallet Slush is not available',
  'all wallets are listed here: []',
  'Wallet Standard has already been loaded',
  'Could not determine how to get wallets from wallet kit',
  'Not saving wallet info - wallet not in available list',
  'Auto-reconnect disabled',
  'Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404',
  'Error storing todo on blockchain',
  'Failed to create todo: Error: Wallet not connected',
  // ... and many more
];
```

**Issues:**
- Legitimate errors like "Error storing todo on blockchain" and "Failed to create todo" are being completely suppressed
- Users won't see any error messages when critical operations fail
- The suppression is too broad and includes actual failures, not just noise

### Location: `waltodo-frontend/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

The ErrorBoundary also suppresses wallet errors that might be important:
```typescript
if (
  rejectionString.includes('select failed: wallet') ||
  rejectionString.includes('UNKNOWN_ERROR') ||
  rejectionString.includes('KIT.UNKNOWN_ERROR') ||
  rejectionString.includes('is not available') ||
  rejectionString.includes('wallet Slush') ||
  rejectionString.includes('all wallets are listed here: []') ||
  rejectionString.includes('Wallet Standard has already been loaded')
) {
  console.warn('[ErrorBoundary] Wallet availability error suppressed.');
  event.preventDefault();
  return;
}
```

## 2. Silent Failures in Frontend Components

### Location: `waltodo-frontend/src/lib/walrus-todo-integration.ts`

Multiple catch blocks that only log to console without user notification:

```typescript
// Line 215-220
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('NFT creation failed:', error);
  onProgress?.(
    'NFT creation failed, but Walrus storage successful',
    90
  );
}

// Line 388-390
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Failed to calculate storage cost:', error);
}

// Line 435-438
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Failed to create todo ${i + 1}:`, error);
  // Continue with other todos even if one fails
}
```

**Issues:**
- NFT creation failures are only logged to console
- Storage cost calculation failures are silently ignored
- Batch operations continue without informing users of partial failures

### Location: `waltodo-frontend/src/hooks/useBlockchainEvents.ts`

```typescript
// Line 114-116
if (!eventManagerRef.current) {
  // Don't spam console with warnings, just return noop
  return () => {};
}
```

## 3. API Server Error Handling

### Location: `apps/api/src/middleware/error.ts`

The API server has proper error handling structure but logging happens at the error level without user-friendly messages being sent to clients in production:

```typescript
// Send error response
res.status(statusCode).json({
  success: false,
  error: message,
  code,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && {
    stack: error.stack,
    details: error,
  }),
});
```

**Issue:** Stack traces and error details are hidden in production, which is good for security but may make debugging user issues difficult.

## 4. CLI Silent Failures

### Location: Various CLI services

Many CLI operations use try-catch blocks that may not properly propagate errors up to the user interface level. The error handling is generally better than the frontend, but there are still some areas of concern.

## 5. Storage Access Errors

The frontend suppresses all localStorage/sessionStorage errors, which might hide legitimate issues:
- Users won't know if their data isn't being persisted
- No fallback notification when storage fails

## Recommendations

1. **Refine Error Suppression**:
   - Only suppress known, harmless third-party library noise
   - Never suppress application-level errors
   - Show user-friendly messages for critical failures

2. **Add User Notifications**:
   - Implement a toast/notification system for non-fatal errors
   - Show clear error messages when operations fail
   - Provide actionable error messages (e.g., "Please connect your wallet")

3. **Improve Error Context**:
   - Add error boundaries at component levels, not just globally
   - Include operation context in error messages
   - Log errors to a monitoring service while showing user-friendly messages

4. **Handle Partial Failures**:
   - In batch operations, report which items succeeded/failed
   - Allow users to retry failed operations
   - Provide clear status indicators

5. **Network Error Handling**:
   - Show connection status to users
   - Implement retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
   - Provide offline mode indicators

6. **Remove Dangerous Suppressions**:
   ```typescript
   // Remove these from suppression list:
   'Error storing todo on blockchain',
   'Failed to create todo: Error: Wallet not connected',
   'Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404',
   ```

7. **Add Error Telemetry**:
   - Log suppressed errors to a monitoring service
   - Track error rates and patterns
   - Alert on error spikes

8. **Improve Developer Experience**:
   - Add debug mode that shows all errors
   - Include error codes for easier troubleshooting
   - Document common errors and solutions

# Test Import Fixes Summary

## Fixed Files

### 1. `tests/integration/error-recovery.test.ts`
**Issues Fixed:**
- Cannot find module '../../../apps/cli/src/services/ai/AIProviderFactory'
- Missing import for `createMockAIModelAdapter`

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced import from non-existent `../mocks/AIModelAdapter.mock` with `../helpers/AITestFactory`
- Removed problematic `jest.mock()` call that was causing module resolution issues
- Added runtime mocking using `jest.doMock()` in `beforeEach()` to avoid early import issues
- Updated mock adapter creation to use `AITestFactory.createMockAIService()`

### 2. `tests/integration/blob-mappings-path.test.ts`
**Issues Fixed:**
- Cannot find module '../../../apps/cli/src/commands/complete'

**Changes Made:**
- Verified that `CompleteCommand` is exported as default from `complete.ts`
- Import was already correct, just needed build to complete
- Added proper type casting for constructor parameters

### 3. `tests/integration/StorageAllocation.test.ts`
**Issues Fixed:**
- Cannot find module '../../../apps/cli/src/utils/VaultManager'

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced simple `jest.mock()` calls with proper mock implementations
- Added explicit mock factories for `VaultManager` and `Logger` classes
- Provided proper mock return values and method implementations

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issues were:
1. **Module Resolution**: Jest was trying to resolve modules before the build process completed
2. **Missing Mock Implementations**: Simple `jest.mock()` calls without proper factories
3. **Import Path Issues**: References to non-existent mock files

## Solution Strategy

1. **Build First**: Ensured `pnpm build:dev` completed successfully before running tests
2. **Runtime Mocking**: Used `jest.doMock()` in `beforeEach()` for modules that need to be mocked at runtime
3. **Proper Mock Factories**: Created explicit mock implementations instead of relying on automatic mocks
4. **Existing Test Utilities**: Leveraged existing `AITestFactory` instead of creating new mock files

## Test Results

All three test files now pass without import errors:
- ✅ `tests/integration/error-recovery.test.ts`
- ✅ `tests/integration/blob-mappings-path.test.ts` 
- ✅ `tests/integration/StorageAllocation.test.ts`

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/angel/Documents/Projects/walrus_todo/tests/integration/error-recovery.test.ts`
   - Updated imports and mocking strategy
   
2. `/Users/angel/Documents/Projects/walrus_todo/tests/integration/StorageAllocation.test.ts`
   - Added proper mock implementations
   
3. `/Users/angel/Documents/Projects/walrus_todo/tests/integration/blob-mappings-path.test.ts`
   - Minor constructor parameter type fixes

## No New Files Created

All fixes were accomplished by modifying existing files and leveraging existing test utilities. No new mock files or dependencies were created, following the project's principle of preferring updates over new file creation.

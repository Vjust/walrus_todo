## Build Process Overview

The build system has been consolidated and improved to provide a more consistent and reliable experience. The primary components are:

- **Unified build script**: A TypeScript-based build tool (`scripts/unified-build.ts`) that handles all aspects of the build process
- **Shell wrapper scripts**: Convenient shell scripts for common build operations
- **Enhanced error reporting**: Improved error handling and feedback during the build process
- **Flexible build modes**: Support for fast transpile-only builds and full type-checked builds
- **Consistent permissions handling**: Automated fixes for executable permissions

## Consolidated Build Commands

The following NPM scripts have been consolidated for clarity and consistency:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "node scripts/run-build.js",
  "build:fast": "node scripts/run-build.js --transpile-only",
  "build:check": "node scripts/run-build.js --type-check",
  "build:clean": "node scripts/run-build.js --clean",
  "build:full": "node scripts/run-build.js --clean --type-check",
  "dev": "ts-node src/index.ts",
  "start": "node bin/run.js",
  "test": "jest --no-typecheck",
  "install:global": "node scripts/install-global.js",
  "update:cli": "node scripts/update-cli.js"
}
```

## Build Script Improvements

The build system now uses a unified approach with these key improvements:

1. **Centralized TypeScript build logic**: All build logic is consolidated in `scripts/unified-build.ts`
2. **Node-based wrappers**: JavaScript wrapper scripts to ensure cross-platform compatibility
3. **Consistent options parsing**: Standardized command-line arguments
4. **Progress reporting**: Clear progress indicators during builds
5. **Improved asset handling**: Better management of non-TypeScript assets
6. **Optimized incremental builds**: Faster builds when only a few files have changed

## Error Handling Enhancements

The build system now provides better error handling:

1. **Error categorization**: Errors are categorized as build errors, type errors, or system errors
2. **Improved error messages**: More descriptive error messages with contextual information
3. **Non-blocking warnings**: Distinguishes between warnings and errors
4. **Exit codes**: Appropriate exit codes for different error conditions

## Permissions Management

Binary permissions are now handled automatically:

1. **Universal permission fix**: The build process automatically ensures executable permissions
2. **Platform-aware behavior**: Handles permission differences between Unix and Windows
3. **Installation verification**: Verifies proper permissions during installation

## Installation and Update Workflows

The CLI can be installed and updated with streamlined commands:

1. **Global installation**: Easy global installation with `npm run install:global`
2. **Self-update mechanism**: Update installed CLI with `npm run update:cli`
3. **Installation verification**: Verification to ensure successful installation

## Development Workflow

For development, the recommended workflow is:

1. **Fast iteration**: Use `npm run build:fast` for rapid development without type checking
2. **Pre-commit validation**: Use `npm run build:check` before committing to validate types
3. **Full builds**: Use `npm run build:full` for release builds with full cleaning and validation

## Implementation Notes

1. The build system respects TypeScript project references
2. Build artifacts are consistently placed in the `dist` directory
3. Source maps are generated for debugging
4. Path aliases from tsconfig are properly resolved

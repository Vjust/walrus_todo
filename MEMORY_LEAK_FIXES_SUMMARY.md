# Memory Leak Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive memory leak fixes applied to the test suite to prevent OOM (Out of Memory) errors and improve test reliability.

## Key Problems Identified

1. **Large static mock objects creating circular references**
2. **Mocks not properly reset between tests**
3. **Jest spy objects holding references longer than needed**
4. **Memory-intensive mock data accumulating across tests**
5. **Insufficient garbage collection between tests**

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Authentication Service Tests (`tests/unit/services/authentication-service.test.ts`)

**Problems Fixed:**
- Static `mockUser` object shared across tests
- Deep object spread operations creating memory leaks
- Missing cleanup in `afterEach`

**Solutions:**
- Converted static objects to factory functions
- Added comprehensive `afterEach` cleanup
- Replaced object spread with explicit property assignment
- Added manual cleanup of singleton state

### 2. AI Service Tests (`tests/unit/aiService.test.ts`)

**Problems Fixed:**
- Static `sampleTodo` and `sampleTodoList` objects
- Environment object deep copying

**Solutions:**
- Created factory functions `createSampleTodo()` and `createSampleTodoList()`
- Simplified environment mocking to avoid deep copying
- Enhanced cleanup in `afterEach`

### 3. Enhanced AI Service Tests (`tests/unit/EnhancedAIService.test.ts`)

**Problems Fixed:**
- Large `MockAIModelAdapter` with unlimited call history
- Static response objects stored in memory
- No call history cleanup

**Solutions:**
- Limited call history size with automatic cleanup
- Converted static responses to factory functions
- Added `clearHistory()` method with size limits
- Created factory functions for test data

### 4. Safe AI Service Tests (`apps/cli/src/__tests__/unit/SafeAIService.test.ts`)

**Problems Fixed:**
- Static test data shared across tests
- Missing comprehensive cleanup

**Solutions:**
- Converted to factory pattern for test data
- Enhanced mock cleanup in `afterEach`
- Added null reference assignments for GC

### 5. Complete Walrus Client Mock (`tests/helpers/complete-walrus-client-mock.ts`)

**Problems Fixed:**
- Large mock objects created statically
- No factory pattern for responses

**Solutions:**
- Converted static responses to `mockImplementation` with factories
- Added lightweight mock variant for simple tests
- Eliminated shared object references

### 6. Memory Leak Prevention Utilities (`tests/helpers/memory-leak-prevention.ts`)

**New Features:**
- Global memory leak prevention setup
- Utilities for creating clean mocks
- Test data factories with automatic cleanup
- Limited array utilities to prevent memory buildup
- Lightweight mock functions with call history limits
- Singleton cleanup utilities
- Memory usage monitoring

### 7. Jest Configuration Updates

**Jest Setup (`jest.setup.js`):**
- Integrated memory leak prevention utilities
- Increased memory limits to 6GB
- Enhanced garbage collection frequency
- Multiple GC cycles in cleanup
- Improved memory growth detection and reporting

**Jest Config (`jest.config.js`):**
- Optimized worker configuration (50% of CPU cores)
- Reduced worker idle memory limit to 256MB
- Enhanced test isolation settings
- Added memory monitoring and reporting

**Memory Test Processor (`scripts/memory-test-processor.js`):**
- Real-time memory usage monitoring
- Warning thresholds for memory consumption
- Automatic memory reports generation
- Forced garbage collection after tests

**Global Teardown (`scripts/jest-global-teardown.js`):**
- Comprehensive cleanup after all tests
- Active handle detection and reporting
- Final memory usage reporting

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Factory Pattern for Test Data
```typescript
// Instead of static objects
const sampleTodo = { /* large object */ };

// Use factory functions
function createSampleTodo(): Todo {
  return { /* fresh object */ };
}
```

### 2. Limited Mock History
```typescript
class MockAdapter {
  private maxHistorySize = 10;
  
  addToHistory(entry: any) {
    this.callHistory.push(entry);
    if (this.callHistory.length > this.maxHistorySize) {
      this.callHistory.shift(); // Remove oldest
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Comprehensive Cleanup
```typescript
afterEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks();
  jest.restoreAllMocks();
  jest.resetModules();
  
  // Clear singleton state
  // Nullify references
  // Force garbage collection
});
```

### 4. Memory Monitoring
```typescript
// Log memory usage in tests
logMemoryUsage('test-name');

// Monitor memory growth
const heapGrowth = finalMemory.heapUsed - initialMemory.heapUsed;
if (heapGrowth > threshold) {
  console.warn('Memory leak detected');
}
```

## Results Expected

These fixes should:

1. **Eliminate OOM errors** during test execution
2. **Reduce memory consumption** by 60-80%
3. **Improve test isolation** and prevent cross-test contamination
4. **Speed up test execution** through better memory management
5. **Provide visibility** into memory usage patterns

## Memory Thresholds

- **Warning Threshold**: 1GB heap usage
- **Critical Threshold**: 2GB heap usage
- **Worker Memory Limit**: 256MB per worker
- **Maximum Heap Growth**: 200MB during test suite

## Monitoring and Alerts

The test suite now includes:
- Real-time memory usage logging
- Automatic memory leak detection
- Memory usage reports after each test run
- Worker restart when memory limits exceeded
- Global cleanup verification

These comprehensive fixes should resolve the memory leak issues and provide a stable, efficient testing environment.
